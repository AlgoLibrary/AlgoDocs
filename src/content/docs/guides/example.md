# Guide: How to Use Documentation and Practice LeetCode Questions

When you're solving LeetCode problems and feel stuck or unable to solve a problem, follow these steps to improve your approach:

1. **Try Solving First**:  
   Before referring to any documentation, try to solve the problem by yourself. Look at the problem statement and think of different ways to approach it.

2. **Read Documentation**:  
   If you are unable to solve the problem, it's time to read the documentation related to the topic or concept. This could include reading about algorithms, data structures, or specific functions you are using in the code. You can also check for articles or tutorials online that explain the topic in more detail.

3. **Try Again**:  
   Once you have understood the concept by reading the documentation, go back to the problem and try to solve it again. Often, reading the documentation will give you a new perspective or the knowledge needed to solve the problem.

4. **Practice Regularly**:  
   The key to improving is constant practice. The more you practice solving problems and read relevant documentation, the better you will become at identifying patterns and solving similar problems in the future.
