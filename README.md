# AlgoDocs

AlgoDocs is a personal documentation project for **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA), along with curated solutions to **LeetCode** problems. The goal is to make learning and understanding DSA simpler through easy-to-follow explanations, visual diagrams, and step-by-step solutions.

> ⚠️ Please note: This is not an official DSA documentation. All content is based on my personal knowledge, approaches, and solutions.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
