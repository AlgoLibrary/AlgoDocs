# AlgoDocs

AlgoDocs is a personal documentation project for **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA), along with curated solutions to **LeetCode** problems. The goal is to make learning and understanding DSA simpler through easy-to-follow explanations, visual diagrams, and step-by-step solutions.

> ⚠️ Please note: This is not an official DSA documentation. All content is based on my personal knowledge, approaches, and solutions.
